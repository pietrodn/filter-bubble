# TODO

* Define "plurality of information"
* Find papers (reply to FB one)
* Moralizing technology debate
* SHORT conclusions

# Interesting quotes

* “The technology will be so good, it will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them.” (Eric Schmidt)


# Points against personalization

Sunstein: citizens would deliberately use technology to over-customize what they read
Pariser: technology companies are already silently doing this for us


# Counterarguments

* "This is not to deny that Silicon Valley engineers, as Pariser argues, have responsibilities that extend far beyond their job descriptions. But their modest quests to improve relevance, alleviate information overload and suggest books that may interest us — rather than to engage in algorithmic paternalism and assume a more critical social role — may be the lesser of two evils."

* Citizens already skip uninteresting, opposed-view content.
