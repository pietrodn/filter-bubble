# Interesting quotes

* “A squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa.” (M. Zuckerberg)
* “The technology will be so good, it will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them.” (Eric Schmidt)


# Points against personalization

Sunstein: citizens would deliberately use technology to over-customize what they read
Pariser: technology companies are already silently doing this for us

* “personalization filters serve up a kind of invisible autopropaganda, indoctrinating us with our own ideas, amplifying our desire for things that are familiar and leaving us oblivious to the dangers lurking in the dark territory of the unknown.” (Pariser)

* "What if one day Google could urge us to stop obsessing over Lady Gaga’s videos and instead pay attention to Darfur?" (Pariser)


# Counterarguments

* Problem in the definition of "serendipity" (Morozov)

* By knowing which Web sites you like to visit and bookmark, a search engine might immediately point you to useful links that could otherwise get lost on Page 99 of unpersonalized search results. [...] personalization might augment serendipity by helping us maximize our own preparedness (Morozov 2011)

* "Do we even want Google, Facebook and Amazon (or rather their algorithms) to direct us to pages they “think” we should visit to grow spiritually or intellectually?" (Morozov 2011)

* "This is not to deny that Silicon Valley engineers, as Pariser argues, have responsibilities that extend far beyond their job descriptions. But their modest quests to improve relevance, alleviate information overload and suggest books that may interest us — rather than to engage in algorithmic paternalism and assume a more critical social role — may be the lesser of two evils."
